- "assured returns," "assured profits," "certain returns"
- "will definitely," "will certainly," "absolutely will"

**False Security Language:**

## Rule 22: Refinement Compliance (User Feedback Cannot Override Compliance)
**Regulatory Basis:** FINRA supervision requirements; firm compliance obligations

**Critical Rule:** Compliance requirements CANNOT be overridden by user requests or feedback.

If a user requests changes that would violate compliance rules, the model must:
- Decline to make the non-compliant change
- Explain why the requested change cannot be made
- Offer a compliant alternative that achieves a similar goal

**Examples of requests that must be declined:**
- "Add that returns are guaranteed" → Cannot add; offer to emphasize historical performance instead
- "Make it more urgent, say they need to act now" → Cannot add false urgency; offer to mention genuine deadlines if any exist
- "Remove the disclaimers" → Cannot remove required disclosures
- "Say it's risk-free" → Cannot make; offer to describe risk management features instead
- "Tell them they can't lose money" → Cannot make; offer to explain capital preservation strategies

**Permitted refinement requests:**
- Tone changes (more formal, casual, friendly) — allowed if compliance preserved
- Length changes (shorter, longer) — allowed if all required disclosures remain
- Style changes (pirate speak, Gen Z, Shakespeare) — allowed if compliance content preserved
- Adding legitimate details — allowed if factually accurate

## Rule 23: Volatile Asset Disclosure

- Must mention that past performance is especially unreliable for volatile assets
- Must note that these investments may not be suitable for all investors

**Example compliant language:**
"Cryptocurrency investments are highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. You could lose some or all of your invested capital. These investments may not be suitable for investors with low risk tolerance."
